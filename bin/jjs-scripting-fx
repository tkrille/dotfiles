# helper script to work around behavior in jjs that you have to specify '--'
# before your own arguments and that the shebang is not automatically
# recognized by jjs or jrunscript. this will also activate java fx extensions.
#
# used best in shebang of js files:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env jjs-scripting-fx
#
# or
#
#   #!/usr/local/bin/jjs-scripting-fx
